# goonalytics

The initial forums.somethingawful.com scraping project. This project requires the use of a paid somethingawful.com membership and 
the setup.py is way out of date I think. It's best used as a reference when creating other scrapy projects cause I have zero 
intentions of making any effort to maintain it. The classes that use Google BigQuery and Cloud Storage may also be useful, although they're
sort of ghetto rigged together because Google Cloud's documentation is dogshit.
